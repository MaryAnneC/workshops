### Getting Started with Scalar

June 2017

## Mary Anne Caton

In this workshop we'll set up Scalar and explore its uses as a non-linear, open source, online publishing tool.  Produced by the Alliance for Networking Visual Culture at the University of Southern California, Scalar allows users to create interactive, media-rich publications without the delays and complications of conventional publishing. Scalar aims to create "rich collaborations between archives, presses, and groups of scholars who can together provide new platforms for scholarship."  Let's take a tour of a Scalar book, as the projects are called, to find out what this semantic web authoring tool offers.

## Overview

Creating the Interactive Book & Using the Dashboard
        
        After you register your account, you'll be able to search for existing books, create your own or copy open ones for annotating. To create an account, use your email as your login, choose a password and link to your website. Your account homepage displays books to which you have access in your role as: author, reader or editor.  Each role conveys different rights.  As Author, you can limit access to your work using the sharing tab to restrict the book's URL, allow duplication and reuquests to join.
